                            Chennai Super Kings were founded as one of the original eight IPL franchises. MS Dhoni was
                            appointed captain, and Stephen Fleming as head coach, marking the start of one of cricket's
                            most successful partnerships. Despite a strong debut season, CSK finished as runners-up,
                            losing to Rajasthan Royals in the final.

                            The IPL moved to South Africa due to general elections in India. CSK finished second in the

                            sensational, winning the Orange Cap with 572 runs at a strike rate of 145. However, they
                            lost to Royal Challengers Bangalore by 6 wickets in the semi-finals. Stephen Fleming
                            officially took over as head coach this season.

                            CSK won their fifth IPL title, defeating Gujarat Titans in a rain-affected final. This
                            victory tied them with Mumbai Indians as the most successful franchise in IPL history. MS
                            Dhoni's leadership in what many believed could be his final season made the victory even
                            more special.

                            MS Dhoni handed over the captaincy to Ruturaj Gaikwad just before the season began, marking
                            the end of his 16-year captaincy reign. However, CSK struggled under new leadership,
                            finishing 5th with 7 wins and 7 losses, failing to qualify for the playoffs for the first
                            time since 2020. This marked a period of transition and rebuilding for the franchise.

                            When Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out mid-season due to an elbow injury, MS Dhoni made a
                            surprising return as captain. The veteran leader once again took the reins in what could be
                            one of his final seasons, showing that CSK's faith in their talismanic captain remains
                            unwavering. The squad retained key players including Jadeja, Pathirana, and Shivam Dube.
